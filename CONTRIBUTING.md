## Git(Hub) Workflow

If you would like to submit a pull request, please follow the below Git
process/workflow. It helps to give us a better paper-trail, and allows us to
follow work through the issue/pull request process.

1. **Create a new issue for the proposed addition/change/fix.** This allows us
   to discuss the suitability of the proposal before you begin work.
2. **Create or sync your fork from `develop`.** To ensure that you're working
   with the latest changes. you can [fork this repository](#fork-this-repository)
   or you can [sync current your fork](#sync-your-fork-with-the-original-repo)
3. **Create a new branch entitled `<fix|add|feature>/<short-description>`.**
   Create a branch for example called `feature/login`. Do all of your work
   in this branch.
4. **Start all commit messages with `[FRONT|BACK][refs #<issue-number>]`.**
   If youâ€™re working on issue 99, all of your commits should begin with
   `[FRONT|BACK][refs #99]`. This allows us to link every commit back to
   an issue.
5. **Open a pull request into `develop`.** Our main branch is `develop`, and
   this is where we want new work to be merged into. `master` is a release
   branch only.
